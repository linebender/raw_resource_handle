Linebender Resource Handle provides functionality for storing blobs of data and an associated ID.
This primitive is adapted in Peniko to store images, but the `FontData` type lives in this repository.
This crate is designed to allow making semver incompatible releases of Parley and Vello, whilst allowing them to be cross-compatible.

This crate is not intended for long-term use, and we expect our resource handling story to change.
That's the reason that this crate has the organisation name ("Linebender") in its crate name; we avoid squatting a more general name after we abandon it.

## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of Linebender Resource Handle has been verified to compile with **Rust 1.70** and later.

Future versions of Linebender Resource Handle might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change and as such can even happen with small patch releases.
